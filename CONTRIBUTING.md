# Contributing to Day One Network Toolkit

Welcome and thanks for considering contributing to this project :metal:

## Ways to contribute

There a few things which would be great if you would like to contribute. 
At a high-level, there are two areas which would be great to get some help with:

### Code review and unit testing  

- Reviewing the code, namely for some more elegant or Pythonic ways of doing things. If you are great at Python, we would love your help!
- Helping work out some unit tests and also how to do this. We are only doing basic linting at this point.


### Feature enhancements 

- Adding additional functionality to the `collection-toolkit` by adding extra data and
worksheets which are collected. For example, an ARP table spreadsheet tab could be of value.
- Adding non-NAPALM support for operating systems not supported by NAPALM. 
For example, provide Aruba OS support using Netmiko to collect configs.
- Propose anything else which you might think help yourself and others, all ideas are welcome!

## Try it out and tell others


It would be great if you tried
it out in your environment and let us know what you think. 
The project performs read-only operations so it's a great starting point for using some automation.

Also, feel free to tell others. This toolkit is meant to showcase some of the benefits
of using [Nornir](https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [NAPALM](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Hopefully, after using the toolkit, it becomes evident how
great those projects are.
