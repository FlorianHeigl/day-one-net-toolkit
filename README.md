# Day One Network Discovery Toolkit #
# PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION #

The purpose of this repository to provide network operators with a day one toolkit to collect information about a new network.

The idea is at the end of day one, you should have the following:

- All running and startup/candidate configs
- All applicable NAPALM getters

This toolkit uses Nornir as the DSL. Being pure python, we can use all the existing Python modules on offer.

TODO
[ ] Produce a compliance retrieval tool which collates key information about devices into a Excel sheet (OS Version, Model, Serial Number, Uptime)
